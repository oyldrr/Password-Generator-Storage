# Password-Generator-Storage
This is a very simple password generator and manager application that I created as part of a visual programming course. I developed this program to improve my C# visual programming skills, and I was able to create the entire app in a short amount of time. Please note that this application is not intended for commercial use, but rather as a tutorial.

## Features
- Generates strong and secure passwords
